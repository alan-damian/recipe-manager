####https://alan-damian.github.io/

This project brings together some features of the spooncular api, such as searching, sorting, and filtering recipes along with their main information.

## What you can do:
Search for a recipe by typing its name, an ingredient or simply a letter to receive suggestions.
Filter according to your personal tastes and specifications.
Find additional information about the most popular types of diets.

## The API is free to use in this project, so it has a limit of requests per day.
